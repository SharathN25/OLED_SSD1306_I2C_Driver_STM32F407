# Interfacing 128 x 64 Dot Matrix OLED Display (SSD1306) on STM32F407 Discovery using I2C Protocol.
This repository tells you how to interface a 128 x 64 Dot Matrix OLED Display on STM32F4xx MCU (I am using **[STM32F407 Discovery Kit](https://github.com/SharathN25/STM32F407-Discovery)**) using  I2C Protocol. Here 4 wires are used for interfacing the OLED display Ground(GND), VCC(3.3V), Serial Data Line (PB7), and Serial Clock line (PB6). The code is written very systematically and it's easy to understand. This driver can be ported for other microcontrollers by simply replacing few functions with MCU-specific APIs.
